 <conbody>
  <p>In some panels, you find a large list of items, which makes it often hard to find the data that
   you're looking for. To help you locate the desired information, such panels have a filter box in
   which you can search for the necessary data.<fig id="fig_o1p_ln2_jw">
    <title>Filter by text</title>
    <image placement="break" href="../../common/images/filter_by_text.png" align="center"
     id="image_p1p_ln2_jw"/>
   </fig></p>
  <p>This filter box is case-insensitive and returns any match, regardless the column in which the
   query data is retrieved.</p>
