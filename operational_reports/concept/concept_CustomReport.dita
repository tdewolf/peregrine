  <p>You can create your own custom operational reports by creating your own query. In the query
   field you can enter natural language, such as “<i>What should we worry about in the next few
    weeks?</i>”.</p>
  <p>The results page varies according the data that you’re looking for.</p>
  <p>For example, when you look up the list of buckets, the results page displays the buckets per
   rack. When you look for the list of things to worry about in the next few weeks, the results page
   displays a list per customer.</p>
