Install Base
============

The :guilabel:`Install Base` panel displays a table with all your customers and some of their basic 
information. 


Install Base Table
------------------

The content of the :guilabel:`Install Base` table depends on the user who is logged in. See the section
:ref:`User Roles <user_roles>` for more information about users.

* :guilabel:`Customer`: Displays the name of the customer.
* :guilabel:`Channel`: The Channel is the sales channel who is responsible for the customer.
* :guilabel:`Region`: The Region indicates where the customer's systems are installed.
* :guilabel:`Systems`: The Systems column displays the number of systems that a customer has deployed.
* :guilabel:`Sentiment`: The Sentiment displays the general feeling of a customer, base on various
  analysis (system health, support response times, ...)

You can sort the table by column. Click the column header to sort the data in ascending or descending
order.


Filtering Data
--------------

To easily find information, you can also filter the data.

To filter the data, you can type any text in the :guilabel:`Filter` field. The text can contain any
information: number of systems, customer name, channel name, or region. Once you start typing in the
:guilabel:`Filter` field, the table is automatically updated with the matching data.
