Top Customers
=============

The :guilabel:`Top Customers` panel identifies the customers with the largest storage volumes. The
graphic also indicates the used storage storage volume. The storage volume is expressed in petabytes.

To display all customers in one graphic, click :guilabel:`All`. This opens a popup window with an
identical graphic including all customers. Use the horizontal scrollbar to scroll through the graphic.
