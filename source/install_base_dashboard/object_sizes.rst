Object Sizes
============

The :guilabel:`Object Sizes` panel displays, per customer, the percentage of stored objects by size.

The objects are divided into three size categories:

* :guilabel:`0 MB to 2 MB`
* :guilabel:`2 MB to 1 GB`
* :guilabel:`> 1GB`

By default the top four customers, with the most stored objects, are displayed. To display this graphic 
for all customers, click :guilabel:`All`. This opens a popup window with an identical graphic with all 
customers. Use the horizontal scrollbar to scroll through the graphic.
