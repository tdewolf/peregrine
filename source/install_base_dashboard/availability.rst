============

The :guilabel:`Availability` panel displays the percentage of uptime per customer. 
The uptime is aggregated for all systems of a customer. 

To display all customers in one graphic, click :guilabel:`All`. This opens a popup window with an
identical graphic including all customers. Use the horizontal scrollbar to scroll through the graphic.
