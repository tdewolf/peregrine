   Erasure Coding
      Erasure coding is a way to split an object into chunks and each chunk is stored on a separate disk.
      The erasure code is able to rebuilt every chunk from other chunks. For example, a 5+1 scheme means
      that your object is divided into 5 segments and 1 parity segment and stored on 6 different disks.
      If 1 disk becomes corrupt, the erasure code is still able to reproduce your object.

   IPMI
      Intelligent Platform Management Interface. It is a remote hardware health monitoring and management
      system that defines interfaces for use in monitoring the physical health of servers, such as 
      temperature, voltage, fans, power supplies and chassis.

   JSON
      JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans
      to read and write and it is easy for machines to parse and generate.
