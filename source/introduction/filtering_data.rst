Filtering Data
==============

The amount of data that is available can be very large. To help you find the data that you're looking for
you can filter these data.


Filtering by Date
-----------------

For each report, you can select a period to retrieve the data. You have weekly, monthly, and
yearly reports, but you can also customize a period.

To select a weekly or monthly report, click respectively on :guilabel:`1 Week` or :guilabel:`1
Month`.

To set a custom period, click the calendar icon (|calendar|) in the :guilabel:`From` and :guilabel:`to`
field and select the proper dates. When you have set the start and end date, click :guilabel:`Apply`. 

The data are updated for the selected period.


Filtering by Text
-----------------

In some panels, you find a large list of items, which makes it often hard to find the data that you're
looking for. To help you looking for the desired information, such panels have a filter box in which you 
can search for the necessary data. 

This filter box is case-insensitive and returns any match, regardless the column in which the query data 
is retrieved.


Ordering by Column
------------------

You can order all data, that are displayed in tables, in ascending or descending way. To do so, click the
column header whose information you want to order; click the header again to reverse the order.
