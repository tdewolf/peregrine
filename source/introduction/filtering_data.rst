Filtering Data
==============

The amount of data that is available can be very large. To help you find the data that you're looking for
you can filter these data.


Filtering by Date
-----------------

To filter the data, you can select a period to retrieve the data. The default period is the last day of 
retrieving the statistics from the |as| systems.

The :guilabel:`1 Week` or :guilabel:`1 Month` buttons allow you to return back in time with respectively
one week and one month. 

You can also set a custom period by clicking the calendar icon (|calendar|) in the :guilabel:`From` and 
:guilabel:`to` field and select the proper dates. When you have set the start and end date, click 
:guilabel:`Apply`. 

The data are updated for the selected period.


Filtering by Text
-----------------

In some panels, you find a large list of items, which makes it often hard to find the data that you're
looking for. To help you looking for the desired information, such panels have a filter box in which you 
can search for the necessary data. 

This filter box is case-insensitive and returns any match, regardless the column in which the query data 
is retrieved.


Ordering by Column
------------------

You can order all data, that are displayed in tables, in ascending or descending way. To do so, click the
column header whose information you want to order; click the header again to reverse the order.
