Introducing |prodlong|
======================

|prod| is a software suite to monitor and analyze all |as| systems. By monitoring and analyzing
the systems, |prod| can inform you for possible issues and gives you the opportunity to proactively
intervene and avoid downtime of the systems. 

For example, |prod| provides a variety of reports which help you better understand the behavior of the 
various |as| systems. Almost every panel in |prod| is a report, but you can also make reports by making 
custom queries.

.. ifconfig:: persona != 'customer'

   The content that you see in |prod| depends on your :term:`persona`; the actions that you can perform
   depend on the :term:`role`.

.. ifconfig:: persona == 'customer'

   The actions that you can perform in |prod|, depend on the :term:`role`.

All data, except for the accounts and user information, are taken from the |as| databases and cannot be 
changed in |prod|.
