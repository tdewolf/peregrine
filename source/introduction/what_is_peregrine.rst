Introducing |prodlong|
======================

|prod| is a software suite which retrieves the useful information from all |as| systems and creates
reports from this data. These reports of the systems give you better insights on how the systems and 
their data are being used. 

For example, you can detect the periods of peak utilization of the |as| systems and verify the 
corresponding performance statistics. Or you can identify the buckets with the highest amount of files or
highest used storage capacity.

Besides the reporting, |prod| analyzes the ingested data and it can correlate two events with each other

The analysis of the data informs you of possible issues and gives you the opportunity to proactively 
intervene and avoid downtime of the systems. 

.. ifconfig:: persona != 'customer'

   The content that you see in |prod| depends on your :term:`persona`; the actions that you can perform
   depend on the :term:`role`.

.. ifconfig:: persona == 'customer'

   The actions that you can perform in |prod|, depend on the :term:`role`.

All data, except for the |prod| user information, are taken from the |as| databases and cannot be 
changed.
