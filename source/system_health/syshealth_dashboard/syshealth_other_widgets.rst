Health
------

@todo: what's the meaning of the values?

The :guilabel:`Health` widget provides the number of critical errors and warnings in a system. These are
divided per type:

* |compute_icon|: compute
* |storage_icon|: storage
* |network_icon|: network


Storage Utilization
-------------------

@todo: is this the raw disk space or the actual amount of data that a system can store?


The :guilabel:`Storage Utilization` widget on the System Health dashboard gives you the global

* amount of free space
* amount of used space
* total amount of storage in the setup
