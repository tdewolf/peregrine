System Health Dashboard
=======================

The :guilabel:`System Health Dashboard` gives you an overview of the selected system's health at a
glance.

@todo: what's the reason to define a date range, shouldn't the system health just show the actual
situation?

On top of the page you can :ref:`specify the date range <filtering_data>` for which you want to consult 
the system health.
