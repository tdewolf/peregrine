Log Analytics
=============

The log analytics give you access to the log files of all deployed setups. In case of errors or
unexpected behavior you can consult the log files to identify the cause of the malfunctioning.

The log files can be retrieved via a timeline or by selecting a node in the rack. Instead of consulting
the log files in |prod|, you can download the data in :term:`JSON` format via the :guilabel:`Download`
link.
