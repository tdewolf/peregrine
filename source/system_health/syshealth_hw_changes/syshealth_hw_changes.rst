On the :guilabel:`Hardware Changes` page, you find a time line of all hardware changes that occurred on
the system. The time line only covers the selected period

The time line indicates replaced parts and added parts information and the affected node.

On the time line itself you find the affected device in a green bullet. Hovering your mouse over the
bullet displays the details of the device, such as type and affected node.
