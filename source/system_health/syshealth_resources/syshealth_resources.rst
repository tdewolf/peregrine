Rack Resources
==============

On the :guilabel:`Resources` tab of a system's :guilabel:`System Health` page, you get an overview of the
setup's resources. A resource is any physical component of the system.

The :guilabel:`Resources` tab displays the location of the setup's rack(s), the rack resource's used
capacity and a detailed inventory of components in a resource.
