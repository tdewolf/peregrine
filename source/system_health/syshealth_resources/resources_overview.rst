Resources Overview
==================

The two top panels of the :guilabel:`Resources` show the geographical location of a setup and the used
capacity per rack in a setup.


Geo Location
------------

In the geographical panel you find the location of the system. Each green dot on the map represents a 
rack of the system. If a system is a 3-GEO deployment, you find dots for each rack.

When the location of two or more racks are too close on the map, they are represented by a slightly
bigger dot on the map. You can zoom in on the map by using the '+'-sign or by double-clicking on the map. 
Double-click on the location where you want to zoom in.
 
When you hover the mouse pointer over green dot, the name of the system and rack appears.


Rack Resource Usage
-------------------

@todo: what capacity, i suppose storage capacity, shouldn't it display at least a unit? To elaborate
after answers.

The :guilabel:`Rack Resource Usage` panel displays the used capacity per rack.
