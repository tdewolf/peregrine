Drive Analytics
===============

|prod| provides analytics for the drives in a storage enclosure. With this analytics tool, you can
compare up to 15 drives at a time. 

There are five different drive analytics:

* :guilabel:`Read Bytes Processed`: the amount of bytes that have been processed in read operations.
* :guilabel:`Write Bytes Processed`: the amount of bytes that have been processed in write operations.
* :guilabel:`Temperature`: the disk temperature
* :guilabel:`Read Errors Corrected with Possible Delays`: the number of read errors that have been
  corrected.
* :guilabel:`Write Errors Corrected with Possible Delays`: the number of write errors that have been
  corrected.


Comparing Drives
----------------

To compare drives, you first have to select the drives that you want to compare and then click
:guilabel:`Drive Analytics`.

To select the drives, simply click any of the drives in the displayed sleds. The drives may belong to 
different sleds.

Working with the Analytics
--------------------------

* Set period: You can update the period of the analytics on top of the :guilabel:`Drive Analytics` page. 
  Either choose one of the predefined periods (:guilabel:`1 Week` or :guilabel:`1 Month`) or set a 
  custom period by defining a start and end date in the respective :guilabel:`From` and :guilabel:`to` 
  fields.
* Select/Deselect Drives: In any of the analytics, the graphic of the selected drives are displayed. You 
  can deselect drives by clicking on the drive number at the bottom of the graphic, the drive number is
  then greyed out and no longer visible in the graphic. To show the drive again in the graphic, click the
  greyed out name again.
* Zoom: You can zoom in the graphic by selecting a part of the graphic. When you have zoomed in, there is
  an horizontal scrollbar which you can use to go back and forth in time on the graphic.
  To reset to the normal zoom level, click :guilabel:`Reset zoom`.
