About Resources
===============

On the :guilabel:`Resources` tab of a system's :guilabel:`System Health` page, you get an overview of the
system's resources. A resource is any physical component of the system.

The :guilabel:`Resources` tab displays the summary of a rack and the rack's full :ref:`inventory 
<inventory>`. In case that the system is a multi site system, you can select the rack by clicking the 
rack name above the rack image. This opens a menu with the list of racks in the system.

|select_rack|

By default the *first* Controller Node of the rack is selected. Click any other device in the rack to
consult its summary and inventory.
