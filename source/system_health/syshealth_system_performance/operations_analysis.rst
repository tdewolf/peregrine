Operations Analysis
===================

The :guilabel:`Total Operations` panel displays a time series of read and write operations and their
corresponding response times. This allows you to identify network issues or a possible degraded system.

In the panel you can zoom in by selecting a section in the graphic. When you start the selection, you 
see the start date and time appear and by moving the cursor, the end date and time of your selection is
displayed in your selection.
