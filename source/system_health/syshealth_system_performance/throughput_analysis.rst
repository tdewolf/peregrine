Throughput Analysis
===================

@todo: is this widget per rack or per setup (f.e. 3-geo or single-geo)
@todo: is MiB/s the unit? don't think Mibs/Second is a valid unit of measurement

The :guilabel:`Throughput` widget displays a time series of throughput statistics for a setup. You can
consult the throughput for PUT operations (black graphics) as well as GET operations (blue graphics).

On top of the :guilabel:`Storage Utilization` page you can define the date range for which you want to 
analyze the throughput. In the widget itself you can refine your selection by zooming in on the graphic.
Click :kbd:`Reset zoom` to return to the default zoom level of the selected date range.
