Storage Performance
===================

Peregrine provides three different storage performance statistics:

* **Total Writes** (default): total number of write operations, averaged across all the Controller Nodes 
  and Storage Nodes.
* **Total Read/Writes**: total number of read and write operations, averaged across all the Controller
  Nodes and Storage Nodes.
* **Total Reads**: total number of read operations, averaged across all the Controller Nodes and Storage
  Nodes.

The Y-axis of the graphics indicates the number of operations. 

The following graphic displays an example of a total writes statistic:
