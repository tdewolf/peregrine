===================

On Compute level, Peregrine captures the following data:

* **CPU usage** (default): CPU utilization, averaged across all Controller and Storage Nodes
* **RAM**: available memory over time, averaged across all Controller and Storage Nodes
* **Total CPU usage**: total CPU utilization

@todo: what's difference between cpu usage and total cpu usage

The following graphic gives you an example of the CPU usage statistics:
