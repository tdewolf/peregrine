All Systems
===========

In the :guilabel:`All Systems` panel of the customer dashboard, you find an overview of the customer's 
deployed systems.

In the overview, you find the following information:

* :guilabel:`System Name`
* :guilabel:`Capacity`: The total raw capacity of the system.
* :guilabel:`Usage`: The percentage of storage in use. Hover over the bar to display the actual
  percentage.
* :guilabel:`Time to Full Capacity`: The time when the system is predicted to have reached its full
  capacity.
* :guilabel:`Sleds`: The total number of Sleds per rack.
* :guilabel:`Deployment`: Indicates the type of the system, single site (1-Geo) or multi site (3-Geo).
* :guilabel:`Version`: Displays the installed version of |as| on the system.
* :guilabel:`Racks`: The total number of racks of the system.

To reduce the number of records in the displayed table, you can add a free text query in the
:guilabel:`Filter` field. Once you start typing, the table is updated with matching records.

For example, if you type :kbd:`1`, the table automatically shows all systems that consists of one rack.
