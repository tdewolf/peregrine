Switch Inventory
================

The switch inventory table contains details for the important attributes of the switch.

* :guilabel:`Port`: number of the switch port
* :guilabel:`Name`: name of the switch port
* :guilabel:`Flow Control Status`: indication if the flow control is active or not
* :guilabel:`Link State`: status of the port link, up or down
* :guilabel:`Physical Mode`: physical configuration of the port, type of port (Automatic, 10G Full, ...)
* :guilabel:`Media Type`: actual capability of the interface, for example 10G-BaseSX
* :guilabel:`Physical Status`: negotiated capability of the interface. If the physical mode is set to "Auto",
  this value is significant because it then indicates the actual negotiated capability
