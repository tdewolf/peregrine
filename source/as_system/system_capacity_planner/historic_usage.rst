Storage Capacity Usage
======================

The :guilabel:`Storage Capacity Usage` panel visualizes the forecast of the storage usage and when the
storage capacity will reach its threshold. The threshold is by default set at 80%.

This graphic allows you to closely monitor the evolution of the storage consumption and to plan for when
to increase the system's storage capacity.

The threshold of 80% is displayed by the orange line in the panel. You can increase or decrease the
threshold line. This automatically updates the date when the storage capacity threshold will be reached. 
Click :guilabel:`Reset` to reset the threshold to 80%.
