Log Viewer
==========

The :guilabel:`Log Viewer` gives you access to the log and configuration files of all nodes of the 
selected system. In case of errors or unexpected behavior, you can consult these logs and configurations 
to identify the cause of the malfunctioning.

Instead of consulting the log and configuration files in |prod|, you can download them in :term:`JSON` 
format via the :guilabel:`Download` link.
