Throughput Analysis
===================

The :guilabel:`Throughput` widget displays a time series of throughput statistics for a setup. You can
consult the throughput for write operations (black graphics) as well as read operations (blue graphics).

On top of the :guilabel:`Storage Utilization` page you can define the date range for which you want to 
analyze the throughput. In the widget itself you can refine your selection by zooming in on the graphic.
Click :kbd:`Reset zoom` to return to the default zoom level of the selected date range.
