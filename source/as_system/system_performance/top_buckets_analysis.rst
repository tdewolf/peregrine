Top Buckets Analysis
====================

The :guilabel:`Top Buckets` widget displays the most active users with regards to Read and Write 
requests.

The table contains the following information:

* :guilabel:`Bucket Name`: the bucket name
* :guilabel:`Reads`: percentage of Read requests on the bucket, as part of all Read requests in all buckets on 
  the system. 
* :guilabel:`Writes`: percentage of Write requests in this bucket, as part of all Write requests in all buckets
  on the system.
* :guilabel:`Total`: total percentage of combined Read and Write requests in this bucket, as part of all 
  requests to other buckets on the system. 
* :guilabel:`Average Response Time`: average response time on the total of Read and Write requests over the set
  time period.
* :guilabel:`Date`: end date of the the requested date range for which you want to retrieve the top buckets 
  information.

You can order the data in ascending or descending order per column. For example, if you wish to order the
table by Write requests, click :guilabel:`Writes` in the header row of the table. This orders your table by
Write requests in descending order. Click the header again to invert the order. The same applies to all
other rows of the table.
