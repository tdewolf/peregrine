Network Usage Pattern
=====================

You can consult the network usage pattern of a system via three statistics:

* :guilabel:`Rx` (default): received amount of data in KB, averaged across all Controller Nodes and Storage
  Nodes.
* :guilabel:`Total Received Packets`: total amount of received packets, averaged across all Controller Nodes and
  Storage Nodes.
* :guilabel:`Total Transmitted Packets`: total amount of transmitted packets, averaged across all Controller
  Nodes and Storage Nodes.

Toggle the node name at the bottom of each graphic to display or hide the node's data. This allows you to
compare the specific node's values aagainst the average values.

The following graphic is an example of the received data network performance:
