Operations Analysis
===================

The :guilabel:`Operations` widget displays a time series of GET and PUT response times. This allows you
to identify network issues or a possible degraded system.

In the widget you can zoom in by selecting a section in the graphic. When you start the selection, you 
see the start date and time appear and by moving the cursor, the end date and time of your selection is
displayed in your selection.
