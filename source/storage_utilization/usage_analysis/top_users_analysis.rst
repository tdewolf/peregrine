Top Users Analysis
==================

@todo: what's the difference between this widget and the :ref:`Top Users from Operational Reports
<top_users>`

The :guilabel:`Top Users` widget displays the most active users with regards to the PUT and GET requests.
The table contains the following information:

* **Users**: the user name
* **Gets**: percentage of GET requests executed by this user. This percentage refers to the number of GET 
  requests. @todo: is this correct? is it about number of get requests or amount of MB transferred
* **Puts**: percentage of PUT requests executed by this user. This percentage refers to the number of PUT
  requests @todo: same question as Gets
* **Total**: total percentage of combined GET and PUT requests executed by this user. This percentage
  refers to the sum of GET and PUT requests. @todo: same question as Gets
* **Average Response Time**: average response time on the total of GET and PUT requests.
* **Date**: end date of the the requested date range for which you want to retrieve the top users
  information.

You can order the data in ascending or descending order per column. For example, if you wish to order the
table by PUT requests, click :guilabel:`Puts` in the header row of the table. This orders your table by
PUT requests in descending order. Click the header again to invert the order. The same applies to all
other rows of the table.
