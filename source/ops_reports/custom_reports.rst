Custom Reports
==============

You can create your own custom operational reports by creating your own query. In the query field you can
enter natural language, such as "What should we worry about in the next few weeks?".

The results page varies according the data that you're looking for. 

For example, when you look up the list of buckets, the results page displays the buckets per rack. When
you look for the list of things to worry about in the next few weeks, the results page displays a list
per customer.
