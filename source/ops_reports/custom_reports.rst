Custom Reports
==============

You can create your own custom operational reports by creating your own query. In the query field you can
enter natural language, such as "What should we worry about in the next few weeks?".

The results page varies according the data that you're looking for. 

For example, the list of buckets is displayed per rack, the list of things to worry about in the next few
weeks is displayed per customer.
