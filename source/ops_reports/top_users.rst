Top Users
=========

The "Top Users" report gives an overview of the users who have been the most active on your system. 

In this report, you find the following information:

* **User**: user name 
* **Capacity**: assigned storage capacity to the user.
* **Gets (Count)**: the number of GET operations during the selected period by the user.
* **Puts (Count)**: the number of PUT operations during the selected period by the user.

Only the first five records are displayed, but you can scroll in the table to get the complete overview.

You can also sort the table by clicking on the column's header row. For example when you click on
:guilabel:`User`, you sort the users ascending or descending. You can easily switch between ascending and
descending order by clicking again on the column's header.
